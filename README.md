## My process

- Expected Dev time 4 hrs
- Actual Dev time   3 hrs
- Spent some time reading Styled-Components docs

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - Custom SVGs

### What I learned

- Nextjs with styled-component [live-example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/main/examples/with-styled-components)
- Created a useMediaQuery Hook for future use

### Continued development

- I'm not exactly sure why the API won't send a new quote, I think they have a cache setup, or maybe Nextjs is messing with it, not sure, could be a mistake on their end.
